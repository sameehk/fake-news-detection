Rand Paul, R-Ky., is expected to announce on April 7. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and other potential candidates have taken preliminary steps towards campaigns.\\n\\nOn the Democratic side, former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is also expected to launch a campaign soon.\\n\\nCruz is set to announce his intentions in a speech at Liberty University, founded by Jerry Falwell, which bills itself as the world's largest Christian university. The Houston Chronicle was the first to report Cruz's announcement.\\n\\nCruz, 44, is just starting the third year of his first Senate term. He is an undisputed leader of the Tea Party movement, known for his brash, uncompromising style and conservative beliefs that target both President Obama as well as his fellow Republicans.\\n\\nHe repeatedly criticizes the \\\"mushy middle\\\" \\u2014 as reflected by the GOP's last two presidential nominees Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain \\u2014 and denounces his fellow Republicans for failing to make bold distinctions with Democrats. \\\"It's a failed electoral strategy,\\\" Cruz has said.\\n\\nPerhaps more than any other potential candidate, Cruz has urged a more aggressive path for Republicans. He has criticized his party leadership for not taking on Obama over health care and immigration and has urged the party faithful to \\\"demand action, not talk\\\" from their elected officials \\u2014 including fellow Republicans.\\n\\n\\\"If a candidate tells you that they oppose Obamacare, fantastic! (But) when have you stood up and fought against it?\\\" Cruz said last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \\\"If a candidate says they oppose Obama's illegal executive amnesty, terrific. When have you stood up and fought against it?\\\"\\n\\nJames Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas in Austin, said the GOP primaries will determine whether Cruz's personality will be an asset or a challenge\\n\\n\\\"His combativeness and tone are a potential problem,\\\" Henson said. \\\"They are part of the image he's cultivated and, from what I have seen, he is not overly concerned with modulating that brand. We're going to see whether it works or not.\\\"\\n\\nCruz begins the race trailing in early GOP presidential polls and lags well behind Bush and Walker, the two leading candidates at this stage. He is expected to compete with Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for support from movement conservatives and Tea Party supporters, and with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum \\u2014 the last two winners of the Iowa caucuses \\u2014 for the votes of religious conservatives.\\n\\nA self-described lifelong conservative who grew up in Houston, Cruz was educated at Princeton and Harvard and clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He had stints in the federal government \\u2014 working for the U.S. Trade Commission and the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration \\u2014 as well as in private law practice.\\n\\nHe returned home to Texas to serve as solicitor general for Greg Abbott, the former state attorney general who is now governor. But it was Cruz's drubbing in 2012 of then-lieutenant governor David Dewhurst in the Senate GOP primary that made him a Tea Party star.\\n\\nLess than a year later, congressional Republicans would praise \\u2014 and blame \\u2014 Cruz for his role in the 2013 government shutdown and this year's dispute over homeland security funding. His marathon protest on the Senate floor in 2013 over the Affordable Care Act led to the partial government shutdown that year and earned Cruz national notoriety.\\n\\nMark Jones, chairman of the Rice University political science department, said Cruz's immediate task is to figure out a \\\"realistic path\\\" that moves him from the second tier of Republican candidates into the first tier now occupied by Bush and Walker. And even if the Texan cannot do that, Jones said a 2016 presidential bid for Cruz still makes sense.\\n\\n\\\"Cruz is at the very beginning of what is certain to be a long and successful political career,\\\" Jones said. \\\"This presidential campaign can be successful even if he does not obtain the Republican nomination, by allowing him to reach out and speak to a broader Republican audience.\\\"\",\n          \"Print \\nIf you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as \\u201cdangerous\\u201d and \\u201ctemperamental\\u201d, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. \\nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are \\u201cgoing to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton\\u201d\\u2026 \\nOn Syria\\u2019s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. \\nClinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and \\u201csafe zones\\u201d on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. \\n\\u201cWhat we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,\\u201d said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.\\u201d \\nIn order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. \\nAnd in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. \\nAccording to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences\\u2026 \\nRussia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. \\n\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,\\u201d Clapper said, speaking with CBS\\u2019 Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. \\nOf course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria \\u201cwould require us to go to war\\u201d \\u2026 \\n\\u201cRight now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,\\u2026 That\\u2019s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I\\u2019m not going to make.\\u201d ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) \\nBut Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. \\nYou see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn\\u2019t for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no \\u201chumanitarian crisis\\u201d in Syria at all. \\nThanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won\\u2019t have anywhere to hide. \\nSo the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. \\nOne recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates \\u2026 \\n\\u201cMrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation \\u2013 at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,\\u201d Putin said. \\n\\u201cNaturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,\\u201d Putin noted. \\nAnyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. \\nAnd even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \\u2026 Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America\\u2019s troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. \\nIn addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia\\u2026 \\nAfter accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. \\nA rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. \\n\\u201cThe US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,\\u201d said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen S\\u00f8reide. \\nMost Americans aren\\u2019t aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. \\nBut in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation \\u2026 \\nRussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. \\nAt the Kremlin\\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. \\nThe country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. \\nI know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. \\nIn my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn\\u2019t know how the election would turn out. \\nAt this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. \\nIf you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don\\u2019t do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. \\nIf the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. \\nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare shares\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"REAL\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
